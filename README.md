Note about new development
==========================
As of November 2014 I'm starting to re-write this using [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) and [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/). The system will be split into two parts, a server and a client.

Please see the [0.1.0 release](https://github.com/argylemachine/music-player/releases/tag/0.1.0) for the old code.
